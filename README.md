MATLAB functions
================
Each of the functions in this folder preceded by `my` were made by me. Other functions were downloaded from MATLAB [FileExchange](https://www.google.com/search?q=fileexchange+matlab&oq=fileexchange+matlab&aqs=chrome.0.0l5.1656j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

These deal with the restrictive high-level plotting functions currently offered by MATLAB, and allow significant customization and utilities suitable for creating publication-quality graphics.

Enjoy!
