%% Points with equal spacing

% points as calculated by DIFFXY are approximated in the same way as the
% native Matlab function GRADIENT, i.e. using the central difference method.
% The endpoints are different because DIFFXY uses a higher-order approximation.

%% N-dimensional data
% As well as operating on univariate data as above, DIFFXY can be used in
% general multidimensional space, obtaining the derivative in any single
% dimension one-at-a-time. This is different to GRADIENT, which returns the
% approximate derivatives in each coordinate direction simultaneously.
